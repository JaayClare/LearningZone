### Integers and Floats are the two main types of numbers that you'll be using in Python


#### Integers ####

# Integers are any positive/negative whole number, including 0
a = 100
b = -150
c = 0


# As seen in video 2, integers can be manipulated using a range of operators
# Check out the 'Operators.py' file for a run through of all the operations


# The type function shows that the variable a is an int.
# This function is useful to use when checking the type of a variable before doing an operation
print(type(a))

# Integers are 'unbounded', this means that there is no limit on their size, it all depends on how much memory your PC has!


#### Floats ####
